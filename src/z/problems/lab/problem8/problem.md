# Problem 8

Using Java 17, Find the sum of digits for all integers between 
min and max(inclusive) and return the max number of integers 
that have an identical sum.

Example: 
min = 5,
max = 23
Output:3

Explanation:

Integers between 5 and 23:               5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23
sum of digits for the above integers :   5 6 7 8 9  
1  2 3  4  5  6   7  8  9 10
2  3  4  5

5 ,14 and 23 have the same sum of digits = 5


The max number of integers that have the same sum of digits[which is 5 as above] is 3.
